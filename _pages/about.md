I am currently pursuing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University, with a depth in Robotics and Automatic Controls. I completed my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (with Honours) at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.

My professional interests include robotics, dynamics and controls. I'm a driven and ambitious individual, with an exceptional academic record and varied experience in many fields. Hard-working and sincere, I fully commit to the task at hand.
