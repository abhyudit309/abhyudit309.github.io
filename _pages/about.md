Hi! I'm Abhyudit. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. I completed my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics, from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, India in 2022.

My coursework specializes in robotics, controls and dynamics. I'm a driven and ambitious individual, with an exceptional academic record and varied experience in many fields. Hard-working and sincere, I fully commit to the task at hand.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, playing table tennis or badminton, watching soccer or cricket, and reading novels.
